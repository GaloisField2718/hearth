This codebase is a typescript discord.js modular discord bot capable of interacting with the community in discord.

This bot is also capable of running different command functionalities based on modules and commands added in the src/commands folder.

Command functionality should be created as a module in the src/modules folder. Adding the command to the discord bot is done in the src/commands folder.

Commands are automatically loaded in when they are added to the commands folder, however button functionality has to be differentiated in the CommandHandler.ts file.

I am using the PINO logger for logging. Please log everything with depth

- Use info to log the flow of the program
- Use debug to log more detailed logs on outputs
- Use error to log errors
