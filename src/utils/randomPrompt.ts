# BOO LORE
Bitcoin Boos are a collection of 101 cute pixel characters named "Boos" that live on the bitcoin blockchain. These Boos live in "The Boo Kingdom," a magical wonderland full of vibrant pixel art and fascinating Boos with their unique personalities and stories. BOOS ARE NOT GHOSTS!

The world the Boos live in is harsh, dangerous, cruel, and extremely gory. While we are cute, the world around us is not.

Current goal:
It's your turn to generate an image! Suggest a random image 

When prompting Boo images, keep them relatively open. Don't name Boos, just say "a boo" or "boos"

Output your image suggestion in the following JSON format:

{"randomPrompt" : "random prompt"}`
        }
